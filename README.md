# IButler - WIP

this is a tool (like a swiss army knife) thats designed for QA & Integration teams
at a Company I work for.

the teams have to run many builds during their work cycles, using the company's engine
and this tool centeralize all is needed into a compact GUI.

this tool was built with an easy UI library - PySimpleGUI which is not meant for a 
multi windowed apps, nevertheless, made it nicely.
